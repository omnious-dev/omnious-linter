    // Several errors can occur when using React and React.Component subclasses. When using React components you must be careful to correctly bind the 'this' reference on any methods that you pass off to child components as callbacks. For example, it is common to define a private method called 'onClick' and then specify onClick={this.onClick} as a JSX attribute. If you do this then the 'this' reference will be undefined when your private method is invoked. The React documentation suggests that you bind the 'this' reference on all of your methods within the constructor: this.onClick = this.onClick.bind(this);. This rule will create a violation if 1) a method reference is passed to a JSX attribute without being bound in the constructor. And 2) a method is bound multiple times in the constructor. Another issue that can occur is binding the 'this' reference to a function within the render() method. For example, many people will create an anonymous lambda within the JSX attribute to avoid the 'this' binding issue: onClick={() => { this.onClick(); }}. The problem with this is that a new instance of an anonymous function is created every time render() is invoked. When React compares virutal DOM properties within shouldComponentUpdate() then the onClick property will look like a new property and force a re-render. You should avoid this pattern because creating function instances within render methods breaks any logic within shouldComponentUpdate() methods. This rule creates violations if 1) an anonymous function is passed as a JSX attribute. And 2) if a function instantiated in local scope is passed as a JSX attribute. This rule can be configured via the "allow-anonymous-listeners" parameter. If you want to suppress violations for the anonymous listener scenarios then configure that rule like this: "react-this-binding-issue": [ true, { 'allow-anonymous-listeners': true } ]
    'react-this-binding-issue': [
      true,
